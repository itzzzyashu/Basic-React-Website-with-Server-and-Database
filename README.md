# Getting Started with Create React App
 Download and extract zip file.
 
### Run the following commands in root directory to get started.
* ```npm install``` - then wait for it to download frontend dependencies.
* ```cd server``` - Getting our server ready.
* ```npm install``` - wait for it to install backend server's dependencies.
* ```cd ../``` - Come out of folder.
* Now fill config in .env.local file or directly replace MONGO_URI in [`server/database.js`](https://github.com/itzzzyashu/Basic-React-Website-with-Server-and-Database/blob/master/server/database.js) at [`process.env.MONGO_URI`](https://github.com/itzzzyashu/Basic-React-Website-with-Server-and-Database/blob/d179198cc722cb80a2eedf213818a13be144bc5a/server/database.js#L4)` as a string.
* ```npm run main``` - Finally Runs our website on [localhost:3000](http//localhost:3000/).
